## List of Required Equipment & Software ## 

@@ Software Requirements
Programming Language: Python (Version 3.8 or newer)

Python Libraries (Dependencies):

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical operations.

scikit-learn: For machine learning models (Random Forest, Isolation Forest, StandardScaler).

tensorflow: For building and training deep learning models (LSTM, Transformer).

matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.

networkx: For graph creation and analysis in the rescue routing simulation.

jupyter: For running the experimental notebooks.

Development Environment: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any similar IDE.

Version Control: Git and a GitHub account for code management.

Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.

@@Hardware Requirements
Computer: A standard desktop or laptop computer.

CPU: Multi-core processor (e.g., Intel Core i5/i7, AMD Ryzen 5/7) is recommended to speed up model training.

RAM: Minimum 8 GB of RAM, with 16 GB or more recommended for handling larger datasets and more complex models.

GPU (Optional but Recommended): An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (e.g., GTX 1660, RTX 20/30/40 series) will significantly accelerate the training of the LSTM and Transformer deep learning models.
